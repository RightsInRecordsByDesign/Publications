# Abstract 

Australian and international research evidence documents the limited access of young people transitioning from out-of-home care (OOHC) to further and higher education. This paper examines the processes, outcomes and key findings of the Raising Expectations project, which involved a collaborative university and industry approach to promote higher education among care leavers at two Australian universities. The project involved consultations with students who had experienced out of home care and reported having met numerous systemic challenges in both the education sector and the welfare/care system that prevented or delayed their advent into higher education. The findings reiterate the importance of policy and practice reforms that target those in or transitioning from OOHC.
