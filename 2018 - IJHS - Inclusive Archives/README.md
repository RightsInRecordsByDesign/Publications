# Abstract 

The need for archiving systems and methodological approaches that acknowledge and accommodate the manifold complexities of memory-making has been well established for decades. Just as history and heritage have come to be understood as domains of (at times hotly) contested narratives, so too the archival sources upon which they draw, and in turn further create, are now increasingly interrogated regarding their intrinsic ideological biases, their role in creating and maintaining power imbalances, and their integrity as products of variant, at times conflicting, motives and points of view. omplement, frame, and support critical archiving and recordkeeping theorizing and practice.  We propose an expansive definition of critical archiving and recordkeeping; one that moves beyond academy-centred, normative critiques and goal-setting to embrace transformative, participatory research and practice, which is particularly relevant to the integrated archiving and recordkeeping needs of individuals and communities.
