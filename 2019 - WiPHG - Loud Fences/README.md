# Abstract 

The meaning of cultural, Or historic, landscape resides in both its aesthetic qualities and the memories and experiences it embodies. Cultural landscape is a complex Of interwoven expressions Of ideas, ideals, ideologies and aspirations, Of layered and contested narratives, of shifting community identity. The connotations of a landscape are often highly personal, while simu taneously reflecting broad public values and sensibilities. This is especially true in the case of revered institutions of the sort that combine a key role in community history, a consciously profound aesthetic quality and a central place in the community's spiritual life. Wherever it is present, the Roman Catholic church has long held a deeply significant place in the cultural landscape, in local history-making and in the urban aesthetc. Everywhere the church is strong in terms of numbers of the faithful; its •penetration' of the social environment makes it highly visible, highly potent as a social agent and centrally important to the local social memory, even among non- Catholic and secular populations. The church embodies tacit narratives of moral and spiritual guidance and Of participation in and shaping Of the growth Of communities' civic historical identity — a dynamic relational status that exemplifies what has been termed 'authorized heritage discourse'This notion of heritage as officially sanctioned practice bound up with the community's defining narratives reveals something of a paradox. The very aspects by which it contributes to social stability and identity also render it vulnerable to the socially disruptive effects of any contestation of those narratives, especially when that contestation is revealed in ways that resonate with people's personal connection with a collective historical consciousness. This chapter addresses some Of the processes involved, and the issues that arise, when such disruptive histories become public fare.
