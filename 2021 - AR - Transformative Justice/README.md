# Abstract

Worldwide inquiries into childhood institutionalization repeatedly document systemic and enduring problems with fractured and fragmented recordkeeping and archiving systems that put the protection of organizations and institutions ahead of the safety and wellbeing of those in their care. As importantly, they demonstrate how much recordkeeping matters in peopleâ€™s lives and the role that records play in developing and nurturing identity, connection to family, community, and culture, and as instruments of accountability, restitution, and redress. They highlight the transdisciplinarity inherent in recordkeeping endeavours, and for research and praxis in child welfare and protection to transcend disciplinary, professional, and community boundaries to ensure that systems created to protect children from neglect and abuse do not themselves cause harm. In this article we explore the transformative justice approach of the Archives and the Rights of the Child Research Programme, that, through transdisciplinary collaborations investigating rights-based recordkeeping, aims to advance archival autonomy, the ability of individuals and communities to participate in organizational and societal evidence and memory structures with their own voice. This broad re-imagining of recordkeeping is vital if we are to escape endless cycles of ambiguous and disappointing transitional justice outcomes, through recognizing voice and agency in recordkeeping as a human right.

# Acknowledgments

The _Rights in Records by Design_ Project is funded through an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant DP170100198. The Chief Investigators are Associate Professor Joanne Evans (Monash University), Associate Professor Jacqueline Wilson (Federation University Australia), Professor Sue McKemmish (Monash University), Associate Professor Philip Mendes (Monash University), Professor Keir Reeves (Federation University Australia), and Dr Jane Bone (Monash University), with postdoctoral fellow Dr Gregory Rolan and research fellow Frank Golding OAM.

Associate Professor Joanne Evans is also the recipient of ARC Future Fellowship FT140100073 _Connecting the Disconnected: Co-Designing Inclusive Archival and Recordkeeping Systems_.

We acknowledge the contributions of all those involved in the Setting the Record Straight for the Rights on the Child Initiative (CLAN, Care Leavers Australasia Network;, Child Migrants Trust, Connecting Home; CREATE Foundation, Centre for Organisational and Social Informatics, Monash University; Collaborative Research Centre for Australian History, Federation University Australia and eScholarship Research Centre, University of Melbourne), and particularly those at the May 2017 Summit (major funding from the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, additional contributions from University of Melbourne, Federation University Australia, and the Australian Society of Archivists/Council of Australian Archives and Records Authority) to the development of the National Framework for Childhood Out-of-Home Care Recordkeeping.

In its seed iteration, funded by the Faculty of IT at Monash University, the _Imagined Archives_ project research fellow, Dr Antonina Lewis, has worked closely with two young women in their twenties, and less intensively with a number of other young people and with a community of later-life care leavers. The project has benefited from the emotional, intellectual, professional, and artistic generosity of many who have shared their time and knowledge, on or off the record. These include individuals associated with: CLAN, Parramatta Female Factory Precinct Memory Projects, Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency, Blak Dot Gallery, Find & Connect web resource, and cohealth Arts Generator.
