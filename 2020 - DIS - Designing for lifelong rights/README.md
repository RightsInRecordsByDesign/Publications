# Abstract 

We describe an approach for designing information infrastructure that addresses lifelong recordkeeping needs for those caught up in the child protection sector. The challenge is to enable people to exert their rights over information as it manifests and changes through time over generational timescales. We conducted a series of participatory design and prototyping workshops over an 18-month period, with a core group of eight academic and community researchers. Using Recordkeeping Informatics to inform critical, rights-based, and trauma-sensitive systems design, we prototyped a distributed and participatory recordkeeping system that allows those with childhood protection experience to participate in their records. In this paper, we describe approaches we adapted for long-term participatory design in sensitive domains, and discuss the design artefacts we developed to capture the complexity of through-time information system design. We propose a set of design guidelines and discuss their implications for design work and systems.

# Acknowledgments

The _Rights in Records by Design_ Project is funded through an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant DP170100198. The Chief Investigators are Associate Professor Joanne Evans (Monash University), Associate Professor Jacqueline Wilson (Federation University Australia), Professor Sue McKemmish (Monash University), Associate Professor Philip Mendes (Monash University), Professor Keir Reeves (Federation University Australia), and Dr Jane Bone (Monash University), with postdoctoral fellow Dr Gregory Rolan and research fellow Frank Golding OAM.

Associate Professor Joanne Evans is also the recipient of ARC Future Fellowship FT140100073 _Connecting the Disconnected: Co-Designing Inclusive Archival and Recordkeeping Systems_.

We acknowledge the contributions of all those involved in the Setting the Record Straight for the Rights on the Child Initiative (CLAN, Care Leavers Australasia Network;, Child Migrants Trust, Connecting Home; CREATE Foundation, Centre for Organisational and Social Informatics, Monash University; Collaborative Research Centre for Australian History, Federation University Australia and eScholarship Research Centre, University of Melbourne), and particularly those at the May 2017 Summit (major funding from the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, additional contributions from University of Melbourne, Federation University Australia, and the Australian Society of Archivists/Council of Australian Archives and Records Authority) to the development of the National Framework for Childhood Out-of-Home Care Recordkeeping.

In its seed iteration, funded by the Faculty of IT at Monash University, the _Imagined Archives_ project research fellow, Dr Antonina Lewis, has worked closely with two young women in their twenties, and less intensively with a number of other young people and with a community of later-life care leavers. The project has benefited from the emotional, intellectual, professional, and artistic generosity of many who have shared their time and knowledge, on or off the record. These include individuals associated with: CLAN, Parramatta Female Factory Precinct Memory Projects, Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency, Blak Dot Gallery, Find & Connect web resource, and cohealth Arts Generator.

Kirsten Thorpe is a PhD candidate within the IT Faculty at Monash University. Her research focuses on Indigenous Archiving and Cultural Safety and examines the role of decolonization and self-determination in libraries and archives. Kirsten’s PhD is funded by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.
